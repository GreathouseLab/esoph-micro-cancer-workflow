# Specific Questions for Update

## Q1: is there a taxonomic signature shared between the barrett's samples?

*[Results Question 1](results-question-1.html)


## Q2: What is the abundance of F. nucleatum and/or Fusobacterium between these samples? - same samples as above

*[Results Question 2](results-question-2.html)
 

## Q3: Is fuso associated with tumor stage in either data set? Does X bacteria predict stage? Multivariable w/ age, sex, BMI, history of Barrett's
Add to this analysis:
Fusobacterium nucleatum

Streptococcus sanguinis

Campylobacter concisus 

Prevotella spp. 

Same questions but using PICRUSt and HUMAnN data - Alison
